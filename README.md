# WorkoutTracker

This application is designed to help user to track workouts customed to whatever the user would like to do.

To run the application locally run the "node server" command to intialize the local host server.

This applicaiton is also deployed to Heroku although the dashboard isn't working properly at this time for unknown reasons. The local host version of the application works like a charm however - just follow the command outlined above to get the server started and the application functionality is all there!

The Heroku side of the application is still being worked on to figure out why the dashboard doesn't load for the user so keep an eye out for that new push in the near future when the bugs are worked out!

The user can then select what kind of workout they are intending on starting and actively track their progress from the dashboard side of the application! Including reps, time, and the amount of resistance if they are doing something like bench press.

This applicaiton makes use of the MongoDB side of JS frameworks and allows certain information to be uploaded to the local server in real time! It also saves their progress when they want to come back to a specific workout.
